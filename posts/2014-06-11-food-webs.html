<h2>The food web</h2>

<p>One of the most fascinating aspect of ecology is the complex web of
interactions between individuals (or populations, or species), and how it
shapes the structure of communities. But what is the best way to represent
these interactions?</p>

<p>The classical representation is a
directed network. <a href="http://mangal.uqar.ca/data/network/17/">Here's
one from the mangal database</a> [2]. We can have predator-prey interactions,
parasitism, mutualism, competition, etc etc...</p>

<p>However, it's a somewhat limited representation. A good way to evaluate a
knowledge representation is to look at the possible queries. What questions
can be answered? What questions cannot be answered? How expressive can the
queries be? How expressive are the answers?</p>

<p>Despite their widespread use, these interactions networks can only answer
one question: is there a binary interaction between X and Y? The <i>binary
</i> part is important, because these networks cannot deal with indirect
relationships such as: X eats Y except when W is there.</p>

<p>It doesn't scale well either: two species might only interact in a given
region, a problem solved with distinct networks, but we would need distinct
networks for every region with distinct interactions and a lot of information
will be repeated.</p>

<h2>Going stochastic</h2>

<p>Instead of saying X eats Y, we could say X eats Y with probability Z.
Adopting a probabilistic perspective does solve quite a few issues. We can
now handle uncertainty and to some extent spatio-temporal variations. That
said, we still cannot handle indirect relationships, and it doesn't scale
that well.</p>

<p>For example, if species A and B compete on the west coast with probability
0.9 but only with probability 0.1 on the east coast, we would lose important
information by having a network say they compete with probability 0.5. Dividing
the network in two would improve our model's accuracy, but we are again getting
in the messy network-of-networks business.  </p>

<p>My supervisors, Timothée Poisot and Dominique Gravel, recently proposed a
metaweb concept that includes, among many other ideas, probabilistic links, but
in their case it's more than just adding probabilities to links [3].</p>

<h2>A unified path to unification</h2>

<p>To criticize an approach to ecology for missing some features is too easy.
All representations have limitations, and any approach to science relies on
some simplification of reality. However, in this case we can have our cake and
eat it too by looking at what is going on in the field of knowledge
representation (KR), which has been defined as [0]:</p>

<p><blockquote>[...] the scientific domain concerned with the study of
computational models able to explicitly represent knowledge by symbols and
to process these symbols in order to produce new ones representing other
pieces of knowledge. Systems built upon such computational models are called
knowledge-based systems. Their main components are a knowledge base and a
reasoning engine.</blockquote></p>

<p>To illustrate, let's look at two lizards: <i>P. cinereus</i> and <i>P.
hoffmani</i> [1]. The two species essentially hunt the same preys but, when
they are found in the same region, character displacement pushes them to
specialize on different preys. This fact cannot be easily express with
standard knowledge representations for food webs, but we can with a bit
of logic:</p>

\[presence(\mbox{cinereus}, r) \land presence(\mbox{hoffmani}, r) \Rightarrow eat(\mbox{cinereus}, A, r).\]

<p>The formula reads: the presence of cinereus in region \(r\) and the presence
of hoffmani in \(r\) implies that cinereus eats prey A in \(r\). Formulas like
this be seen as templates: presence(cinereus) will be either true or false at
any given place, but a probability is assigned to the entire formula so it can
be revised with new evidence [4]. This is an important point, it means we can
use the standard food webs as evidence to build these logical formulas, but we
still get a probabilistic model capable of handling uncertainty.</p>

<p>The formula is readable, can be used with modern inference tools, and is
very flexible, but there's better. What if the presence of cinereus in \(r\)
could be predicted with a few conditions, we could have something like
this:</p>

\[northAmerica(r) \land (presence(A, r) \lor presence(B, r)) \Rightarrow presence(\mbox{cinereus}, r).\]

<p>If the region \(r\) is in north America and if either species A or B are
present, then cinereus will be present. Again, this equation would be
assigned a probability. This is a simplistic model of presence/absence, but
the point is that this knowledge representation allows different formula to
be combined. Various evidence can be used together instead of having a wall
between ecological facts, and such database of probabilistic logical formula
supports sophisticated queries.</p>

<p>There are many discussions about having integrative frameworks and
theories in ecology. This is especially true for interaction networks, which
are often present in one form or another in ecology. Ironically, these
discussions of integration are often ignoring modern research in
other fields. Knowledge representation offers powerful tools with mature
software that are worth checking, especially if we want to understand
how different ideas and evidence can be combined.</p>
